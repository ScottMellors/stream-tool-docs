# MultiStream Subathons with StreamTimer.io

Currently the timer works on having a primary platform (the one you log in with) and external software can handle the other platforms.

## Get started

First you will need to acquire the relevant connector actions or software to trigger the new platform actions.

These can be acquired from the [Ko-Fi Shop](https://ko-fi.com/ghostlytuna/shop).

## Setup for StreamerBot actions

1. Import actions and commands into StreamerBot
2. Add "StreamTimer UUID" global variable using the UUID from the options page.

3. Connect platform with associated command. Check store listing for more info!

*If Successful, you should get the above output.*

4. If the platform was already supported on the website, visiting the options page will now list the associated platform and events.

NOTE: Some platforms may be controlled by the actions themselves, check the store listing for more info.

5. Now fully setup, the events should trigger as expected. You can test these by testing the triggers in StreamerBot.

## Not got a platform or app listed as support?

Let me know and we can add it to the roadmap or build something bespoke.
