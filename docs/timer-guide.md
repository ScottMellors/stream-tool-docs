## FAQ

> Q: Why is my time disappearing/ resetting when I add time?

The usual issue users run into is the timer appearing to reset when time is added. This is usually when labels had not been set to account for time overflowing to the next level (minutes to hours, hours to days).

If you have the default timer labels set, you will only have hours and minutes on display.

Just add the relevant labels to your timer layout e.g. `{days}` or `{totalhours}` whatever your preference is!

> Q: How do the labels work?

Labels are placeholders for the values they relate to. So `{hours}` will change to the current hours value, see options page for advanced label features like optional labels.

> Q: Can I do a subathon using multiple platforms?

Yes! Check out how to get started [here](/stream-tool-docs/docs/timer-crossplatform-guide.md).

> Q: Why has my primary platform changed on my StreamElements account?

Depending on which platform is active on your account will swap which is your primary platform when using a StreamElements account. Simply change the active account on StreamElements and log back in to the options page to change platform.
