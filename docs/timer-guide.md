## FAQ

> Q: Why is my time disappearing/ resetting when I add time?

The usual issue users run into is the timer appearing to reset when time is added. This is usually when labels had not been set to account for time overflowing to the next level (minutes to hours, hours to days).

If you have the default timer labels set, you will only have hours and minutes on display.

Just add the relevant labels to your timer layout e.g. `{days}` or `{totalhours}` whatever your preference is!

> Q: How do the labels work?

> Q: Can I do a subathon using multiple platforms?

Yes! Check out how to get started [here](/stream-tool-docs/docs/timer-crossplatform-guide).
